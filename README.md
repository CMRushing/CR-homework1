<h1>Horiseon Accessibility Changes</h1>

<p>Hey so in order to make this webpage more accessible to everyone I made some changes in orignal coding for the website. I added Semantic Html tags in order to accomplish this feat. These changes were necessary in order to follow the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act that was passed in 1990. Its a Civil Rights Act that prohibits Discrimmination based on disabilites. Every public organization, company and wbsite must follow these gudelines. In past years may people/companies have been sued because they didnt make sure they followed these guidelines. 
  In order to avoid any form of scrutiny, offense or law suit, changes were made to make sure these guidelines were followed. Some of the changes I made included, replacing div tags with section, aside, nav and summary tags. I also created a footer tag. I created buttons for the Search Engine Optimization, Reputation Management and Media Marketing, in order to indicate that they can be pressed. I also rounded the borders on those buttons as well as the borders around the elemets in the aside tag. I rounded corners on specific elements for them to be more noticeable. 
  I did change the way the page looked by chossing some colors that I think contasted better to make everything more noticeable, but I was able to do this without changing the functionality of the page.<p>
